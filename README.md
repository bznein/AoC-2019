# AoC-2019
Partially in Rust, partially in C++

and YES, I KNOW, the solution in Rust have the input hardcoded into it. I am solving them using https://play.rust-lang.org/ which does not support input redirection/multiple files.

## Update 06/12/2019
I am currently in the process of reordering the repository. Next solutions (from day7) should not use hardcoded input anymore.
